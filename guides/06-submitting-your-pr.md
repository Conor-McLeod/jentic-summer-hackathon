# 06 – Submitting Your PR (5 mins)

*How to submit your hackathon contribution for evaluation*

## Quick Overview

All hackathon submissions go to the **main summer hackathon repository** where you found the tracks. This keeps everything organized in one place for judging and community visibility.

## Step-by-Step Submission

### 1. 🍴 Fork the Hackathon Repo
```bash
# If you haven't already:
git clone https://github.com/jentic/summer-hackathon-2025.git
cd summer-hackathon-2025

# Or if you forked it:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/summer-hackathon-2025.git
cd summer-hackathon-2025
```

### 2. 🌿 Create Your Feature Branch
Use this naming convention for easy organization:
```bash
# Format: submission/track-XX-your-name-or-team
git checkout -b submission/track-06-jane-doe
git checkout -b submission/track-13-team-awesome
git checkout -b submission/track-02-multitrack-alice
```

### 3. 📁 Add Your Work to the Right Track Folder

**For most tracks:**
```bash
# Add your code/files to your track's submissions folder
tracks/track-06/submissions/your-name/
├── README.md           # Setup & demo instructions
├── your-prompts.md     # Your actual work
├── examples/           # Working examples
└── demo-screenshots/   # Visual proof
```

**For multi-track submissions:**
```bash
# Create a combined submission folder
tracks/multi-track-submissions/your-name/
├── README.md           # Overview of all tracks
├── track-06/          # Track 6 work
├── track-13/          # Track 13 work
└── demo-evidence/     # Screenshots/videos
```

### 4. 📝 Follow Your Track's Submission Structure

Each track has specific requirements - check your track folder for:
- `tracks/track-XX/README.md` - Submission requirements
- `tracks/track-XX/examples/` - Example submissions
- `tracks/track-XX/submission-template/` - File templates

**Essential files for ALL submissions:**
- `README.md` - Clear setup instructions
- `demo-evidence/` - Screenshots or video proof
- Your actual work (code, prompts, docs, etc.)

### 5. ✅ Use the Quality Checklists

- **Prompts**: `checklists/prompt-submission-checklist.md`
- **API Specs**: `checklists/api-spec-quality-checklist.md`

### 6. 🧪 Test in Clean Environment

```bash
# Test your setup instructions work from scratch
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/summer-hackathon-2025.git
cd summer-hackathon-2025/tracks/track-XX/submissions/your-name/

# Follow your own README - does it work?
# Fix any issues, then push updates
```

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### "I can't find the right folder structure"
Check `tracks/track-XX/examples/` for reference submissions from previous events.

### "My PR conflicts with main"
```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout your-branch
git rebase main
# Resolve conflicts, then git push --force-with-lease
```

### "I worked on multiple tracks"
Create a `multi-track-submissions/your-name/` folder with clear organization by track.

### "I forked the wrong repo"
You want to fork `jentic/summer-hackathon-2025`, not the individual Jentic tool repos.

### "My submission is too large"
- Use `.gitignore` for large files
- Put videos on YouTube/Loom and link them
- Compress images before committing

## 🎯 Pro Tips for Strong Submissions

### Make It Easy for Judges
- **Clear README** - Judges should understand your project in 30 seconds
- **One-command demo** - `python demo.py` should just work
- **Visual evidence** - Screenshots speak louder than code

### Stand Out from the Crowd  
- **Solve real problems** - Address pain points you've experienced
- **Show measurable impact** - "Reduces setup time from 2 hours to 5 minutes"
- **Polish the presentation** - Clean code, good docs, professional README

### Maximize Your Points
- **Complete the core requirements** first, then add bonuses
- **Document thoroughly** - Good docs can bump you up a tier
- **Test everything** - Broken demos lose points fast
- **Share on social media** - Easy bonus points for posting

## 🎉 After Submission

1. **Automated checks** run on your PR (linting, basic tests)
2. **Community feedback** - Other participants may comment
3. **Judge evaluation** - Usually within 2-3 days

### Keep Building
