# Daft.ie Unofficial Public API Documentation

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Source:** Reverse-engineered from public web traffic on `https://www.daft.ie`.

## 1. Overview

This document provides a comprehensive reference for the unofficial public API of Daft.ie. The endpoints detailed below were discovered by analyzing the network traffic between a web browser and the Daft.ie servers during a typical user session.

The primary purpose of this documentation is to enable developers and AI agents to programmatically access public property data for search, analysis, and discovery.

**Disclaimer:** This is not an official API. The endpoints, parameters, and response structures are subject to change without notice as the Daft.ie website evolves. Use this information responsibly and be mindful of the website's terms of service.

## 2. Authentication

The majority of the endpoints documented here are **public** and do not require an API key or user authentication. They can be accessed directly.

The `/api/user` endpoint is used for checking a user's session status but does not provide access to protected data when called without valid session cookies.

## 3. Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the following base URL:

```
https://www.daft.ie
```

## 5. Troubleshooting and Common Issues

#### **Issue: The `/property.json` endpoint returns a 404 Not Found error.**

*   **Cause:** The `{buildId}` in the path is a dynamic value that changes whenever Daft.ie deploys a new version of their website. The example `buildId` in this documentation will quickly become outdated.
*   **Solution:** Before making a call to this endpoint, you must first visit a property page on Daft.ie and inspect the network traffic to find a current, valid `{buildId}`.

#### **Issue: My requests are being blocked or I'm getting a CAPTCHA challenge.**

*   **Cause:** Making a high volume of automated requests may trigger anti-scraping and anti-bot measures.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  Keep your request rate low and mimic a real user's browsing speed.
    2.  Include a realistic `User-Agent` header in your requests.
    3.  This is a fundamental risk of using an unofficial API. There is no guaranteed solution.

#### **Issue: An endpoint has stopped working or the response format has changed.**

*   **Cause:** Since this API is undocumented and unofficial, it can be changed by the Daft.ie development team at any time without warning.
*   **Solution:** You will need to re-run the discovery process by capturing a new HAR file and analyzing the network traffic to understand the new endpoint structure.
