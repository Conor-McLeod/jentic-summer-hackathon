# Track 15 â€“ Agent Behavior Modification System

**Goal**: Build a real-time agent reconfiguration system that allows dynamic behavior modification through natural language commands, enabling runtime policy changes and behavioral constraints.

**Time Estimate**: 8-12 hours (full weekend+)  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Perfect for**: Developers interested in agent control systems, policy management, and dynamic AI behavior modification

## What You'll Build

**A comprehensive behavior modification system** that enables:
- **Natural Language Policy Definition**: "Only run on weekdays", "Never respond to this person"
- **Real-time Behavior Changes**: Modify agent behavior without restarting
- **Conditional Logic**: Complex rules based on time, context, user, or content
- **Safety Constraints**: Prevent dangerous or unwanted agent behaviors
- **Audit and Compliance**: Track behavior changes and policy enforcement

**Your deliverable**: A Standard Agent extension that can dynamically modify its behavior based on natural language instructions and contextual rules.

## The Challenge

**Current Limitation**: Standard Agent behavior is largely fixed at initialization time. Changing agent behavior requires code changes and restarts.

**Real-World Need**: Organizations and users need to:
- Adjust agent behavior based on changing requirements
- Implement safety controls and compliance rules
- Handle different users with different permissions
- Adapt to time-based or contextual constraints
- Respond to incidents or policy changes immediately

**Your Solution**: Build a dynamic behavior modification system that bridges natural language instructions and runtime agent control.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Behavior Policy Engine
```python
class BehaviorPolicyEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_policies = []
        self.policy_resolver = PolicyResolver()
        self.context_evaluator = ContextEvaluator()
    
    def add_policy(self, policy: BehaviorPolicy):
        # TODO: Add new behavior policy to active set
        pass
    
    def remove_policy(self, policy_id: str):
        # TODO: Remove policy from active set
        pass
    
    def evaluate_action(self, action: AgentAction, context: ActionContext) -> PolicyDecision:
        # TODO: Evaluate if action is allowed under current policies
        pass
    
    def modify_behavior(self, modification_request: str) -> PolicyUpdateResult:
        # TODO: Parse natural language modification and update policies
        pass
```

#### 2. Natural Language Policy Parser
```python
class PolicyParser:
    def parse_modification_request(self, request: str) -> List[PolicyRule]:
        # TODO: Convert natural language to structured policy rules
        # Examples:
        # "Only run on weekdays" -> TimeBasedRule(days=[1,2,3,4,5])
        # "Never respond to john@example.com" -> UserBlockRule(email="john@example.com")
        # "Don't send emails after 6 PM" -> TimeBasedActionRule(action="email", time_constraint="after_18:00", allow=False)
        pass
    
    def validate_policy_rules(self, rules: List[PolicyRule]) -> ValidationResult:
        # TODO: Check for conflicts, impossibilities, and safety issues
        pass
```

#### 3. Runtime Behavior Controller
```python
class RuntimeBehaviorController:
    def __init__(self, agent: StandardAgent):
        self.agent = agent
        self.policy_engine = BehaviorPolicyEngine()
        self.modification_history = []
    
    def intercept_agent_action(self, action: AgentAction, context: ActionContext) -> ActionDecision:
        # TODO: Intercept agent actions and apply policy evaluation
        decision = self.policy_engine.evaluate_action(action, context)
        
        if decision.allowed:
            return ActionDecision.PROCEED
        else:
            return ActionDecision.BLOCK(reason=decision.reason)
    
    def modify_agent_behavior(self, modification_request: str, requester: User) -> ModificationResult:
        # TODO: Process behavior modification request
        pass
```

#### 4. Context and State Management
```python
class BehaviorContext:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_time = None
        self.current_user = None
        self.conversation_history = []
        self.system_state = {}
        self.security_level = "normal"
    
    def update_context(self, **kwargs):
        # TODO: Update context information for policy evaluation
        pass
    
    def get_context_for_evaluation(self) -> Dict:
        # TODO: Return context dict for policy evaluation
        pass
```

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Policy Framework (3-4 hours)

#### Basic Policy Types
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from datetime import datetime, time
from typing import List, Dict, Any

class PolicyRule(ABC):
    def __init__(self, rule_id: str, description: str):
        self.rule_id = rule_id
        self.description = description
        self.created_at = datetime.now()
        self.active = True
    
    @abstractmethod
    def evaluate(self, action: AgentAction, context: BehaviorContext) -> PolicyDecision:
        pass

class TimeBasedRule(PolicyRule):
    def __init__(self, rule_id: str, allowed_times: List[time], allowed_days: List[int]):
        super().__init__(rule_id, "Time-based access control")
        self.allowed_times = allowed_times
        self.allowed_days = allowed_days  # 0=Monday, 6=Sunday
    
    def evaluate(self, action: AgentAction, context: BehaviorContext) -> PolicyDecision:
        # TODO: Check if current time/day allows the action
        pass

class UserBasedRule(PolicyRule):
    def __init__(self, rule_id: str, allowed_users: List[str], blocked_users: List[str]):
        super().__init__(rule_id, "User-based access control")
        self.allowed_users = allowed_users
        self.blocked_users = blocked_users
    
    def evaluate(self, action: AgentAction, context: BehaviorContext) -> PolicyDecision:
        # TODO: Check if current user is allowed to trigger this action
        pass

class ActionBasedRule(PolicyRule):
    def __init__(self, rule_id: str, restricted_actions: List[str], conditions: Dict):
        super().__init__(rule_id, "Action-based restrictions")
        self.restricted_actions = restricted_actions
        self.conditions = conditions
    
    def evaluate(self, action: AgentAction, context: BehaviorContext) -> PolicyDecision:
        # TODO: Check if action type is restricted under current conditions
        pass
```

#### Policy Decision Logic
```python
class PolicyDecision:
    def __init__(self, allowed: bool, reason: str = "", modified_action: AgentAction = None):
        self.allowed = allowed
        self.reason = reason
        self.modified_action = modified_action  # For action modification rather than blocking

class PolicyResolver:
    def resolve_conflicts(self, decisions: List[PolicyDecision]) -> PolicyDecision:
        # TODO: Handle cases where multiple policies conflict
        # Default: most restrictive wins
        # Advanced: priority-based resolution
        pass
    
    def combine_decisions(self, decisions: List[PolicyDecision]) -> PolicyDecision:
        # TODO: Combine multiple policy decisions into final decision
        pass
```

### Phase 2: Natural Language Processing (3-4 hours)

#### Intent Recognition
```python
class ModificationIntentClassifier:
    def classify_intent(self, request: str) -> ModificationIntent:
        # TODO: Classify the type of modification requested
        # Examples:
        # "Only run on weekdays" -> TIME_RESTRICTION
        # "Block user john@example.com" -> USER_RESTRICTION  
        # "Don't send emails" -> ACTION_RESTRICTION
        # "Increase security level" -> SECURITY_MODIFICATION
        pass
    
    def extract_parameters(self, request: str, intent: ModificationIntent) -> Dict:
        # TODO: Extract specific parameters from natural language
        # Use LLM or NLP libraries to parse structured information
        pass
```

#### LLM-Powered Policy Generation
```python
class LLMPolicyGenerator:
    def __init__(self, llm_client):
        self.llm = llm_client
    
    def generate_policy_from_request(self, request: str, context: Dict) -> List[PolicyRule]:
        # TODO: Use LLM to convert natural language to policy rules
        prompt = f"""
        Convert this behavior modification request into structured policy rules:
        Request: "{request}"
        Context: {context}
        
        Generate specific, enforceable policy rules that implement this request.
        Consider edge cases and potential conflicts.
        """
        
        # TODO: Send to LLM and parse structured response
        pass
    
    def validate_generated_policy(self, policy: PolicyRule, original_request: str) -> bool:
        # TODO: Verify the generated policy matches the intent
        pass
```

#### Conflict Detection
```python
class PolicyConflictDetector:
    def detect_conflicts(self, new_policy: PolicyRule, existing_policies: List[PolicyRule]) -> List[Conflict]:
        # TODO: Identify potential conflicts between policies
        conflicts = []
        
        for existing in existing_policies:
            conflict = self.check_policy_pair(new_policy, existing)
            if conflict:
                conflicts.append(conflict)
        
        return conflicts
    
    def suggest_resolutions(self, conflicts: List[Conflict]) -> List[Resolution]:
        # TODO: Suggest ways to resolve policy conflicts
        pass
```

### Phase 3: Runtime Integration (2-3 hours)

#### Agent Action Interception
```python
class BehaviorModifiedAgent(StandardAgent):
    def __init__(self, llm, tools, memory, reasoner, behavior_controller):
        super().__init__(llm, tools, memory, reasoner)
        self.behavior_controller = behavior_controller
    
    def solve(self, goal: str) -> str:
        # TODO: Intercept and evaluate goal before processing
        context = self.build_context(goal)
        decision = self.behavior_controller.evaluate_goal(goal, context)
        
        if not decision.allowed:
            return f"Cannot process request: {decision.reason}"
        
        # Modify goal if needed
        modified_goal = decision.modified_goal or goal
        
        # Continue with normal processing
        return super().solve(modified_goal)
    
    def execute_tool_call(self, tool_call: ToolCall) -> ToolResult:
        # TODO: Intercept tool calls and apply policies
        context = self.build_tool_context(tool_call)
        decision = self.behavior_controller.evaluate_tool_call(tool_call, context)
        
        if not decision.allowed:
            return ToolResult.blocked(reason=decision.reason)
        
        return super().execute_tool_call(tool_call)
```

#### Real-time Policy Updates
```python
class PolicyUpdateManager:
    def __init__(self, behavior_controller):
        self.controller = behavior_controller
        self.update_queue = []
        self.active_modifications = {}
    
    def queue_modification(self, request: str, requester: User, priority: int = 0):
        # TODO: Queue modification request for processing
        modification = ModificationRequest(request, requester, priority)
        self.update_queue.append(modification)
    
    def process_modification_queue(self):
        # TODO: Process queued modifications in priority order
        while self.update_queue:
            mod = self.update_queue.pop(0)
            result = self.apply_modification(mod)
            self.log_modification_result(mod, result)
    
    def apply_modification(self, modification: ModificationRequest) -> ModificationResult:
        # TODO: Apply behavior modification to active agent
        pass
```

## Example Use Cases

### Time-Based Restrictions
```python
# Example: Implement business hours restrictions
modification_requests = [
    "Only respond to requests during business hours (9 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday)",
    "Don't send emails after 6 PM or on weekends",
    "Increase security level outside of business hours"
]

# Generated policies:
# TimeBasedRule(allowed_times=[time(9,0), time(17,0)], allowed_days=[0,1,2,3,4])
# ActionBasedRule(restricted_actions=["send_email"], time_conditions={"after": time(18,0), "weekends": True})
# SecurityLevelRule(level="high", time_conditions={"outside_business_hours": True})
```

### User-Based Controls
```python
# Example: Implement user access controls
modification_requests = [
    "Block all requests from user@spam.com",
    "Only allow admin users to access financial data",
    "Require approval for requests from external users"
]
```

### Content and Action Restrictions
```python
# Example: Content safety and compliance
modification_requests = [
    "Don't process requests containing personal information",
    "Block any requests to delete or modify data",
    "Require human approval for financial transactions over $1000"
]
```

### Emergency and Incident Response
```python
# Example: Incident response scenarios
emergency_modifications = [
    "Immediately block all external API access",
    "Only allow read-only operations until further notice",
    "Escalate all requests to human operators"
]
```

## Advanced Features

### Policy Learning and Adaptation
```python
class AdaptivePolicyEngine:
    def learn_from_usage_patterns(self, usage_history: List[AgentAction]):
        # TODO: Analyze patterns and suggest policy improvements
        pass
    
    def adapt_policies_based_on_feedback(self, feedback: UserFeedback):
        # TODO: Modify policies based on user satisfaction and outcomes
        pass
```

### Multi-Agent Policy Coordination
```python
class PolicySyncManager:
    def sync_policies_across_agents(self, agents: List[BehaviorModifiedAgent]):
        # TODO: Coordinate policies across multiple agent instances
        pass
    
    def handle_cross_agent_conflicts(self, agents: List[BehaviorModifiedAgent]):
        # TODO: Resolve conflicts when agents have different policies
        pass
```

### Policy Versioning and Rollback
```python
class PolicyVersionManager:
    def create_policy_checkpoint(self, policies: List[PolicyRule]) -> PolicyCheckpoint:
        # TODO: Create versioned snapshot of current policies
        pass
    
    def rollback_to_checkpoint(self, checkpoint_id: str) -> RollbackResult:
        # TODO: Restore previous policy state
        pass
```

## Security and Safety Considerations

### Authorization and Authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Different users can make different types of modifications
- **Approval Workflows**: Sensitive modifications require approval
- **Audit Logging**: All modifications are logged with timestamps and requesters
- **Emergency Override**: Safety mechanisms to override dangerous policies

### Policy Validation
- **Safety Checks**: Prevent policies that could break agent functionality
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle contradictory policy requirements
- **Scope Limits**: Restrict what can be modified based on user permissions
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to undo problematic modifications

## Testing and Validation

### Test Scenarios
```python
def test_time_based_restrictions():
    # Test that agent respects business hours
    agent = create_test_agent()
    agent.modify_behavior("Only work during business hours")
    
    # Test during business hours
    result = agent.solve("Send an email", context=BusinessHoursContext())
    assert result.success
    
    # Test outside business hours
    result = agent.solve("Send an email", context=AfterHoursContext())
    assert not result.success

def test_user_restrictions():
    # Test user-based blocking
    agent = create_test_agent()
    agent.modify_behavior("Block user spam@example.com")
    
    result = agent.solve("Help me", context=UserContext(email="spam@example.com"))
    assert not result.success

def test_conflict_resolution():
    # Test handling of conflicting policies
    agent = create_test_agent()
    agent.modify_behavior("Allow all users")
    agent.modify_behavior("Block user john@example.com")
    
    result = agent.solve("Help me", context=UserContext(email="john@example.com"))
    assert not result.success  # More restrictive policy wins
```
