# Track 07 â€“ API Quality Scorecard

**Goal**: Build a tool that evaluates OpenAPI specifications for agent-readiness, providing scores and actionable recommendations for improving API usability by AI agents.

**Time Estimate**: 3-4 hours  
**Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate  
**Perfect for**: Developers interested in API quality, automation, and making APIs more accessible to AI agents

## What You'll Build

An automated scorecard system that:
- **Analyzes OpenAPI specifications** for completeness and quality
- **Scores APIs** on agent-readiness criteria
- **Provides actionable recommendations** for improvement
- **Generates reports** that help API developers optimize for AI usage

**Your deliverable**: A tool that can take any OpenAPI spec and produce a detailed quality report with scores, issues, and improvement suggestions.

## Prerequisites

### Technical Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Understanding of OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- Basic JSON/YAML processing knowledge
- Familiarity with API documentation concepts

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Understanding of REST API principles
- Basic familiarity with OpenAPI specification structure
- Knowledge of what makes APIs usable by developers and agents
- No advanced programming experience required

## The Problem

Many APIs are **technically valid** but **poorly suited for AI agents**:
- **Missing descriptions** make it hard for agents to understand purpose
- **Incomplete schemas** prevent proper request/response handling
- **Poor error documentation** leads to agent confusion
- **Complex authentication** without clear guidance
- **Inconsistent naming** makes operations hard to discover

**Your tool will identify these issues and suggest fixes.**

## Getting Started (30 minutes)

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir api-quality-scorecard
cd api-quality-scorecard

# Set up Python environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Understand the Scoring Framework
Your scorecard will evaluate APIs across key dimensions:

**Core Categories (100 points total)**:
- **Documentation Quality** (25 points) - Descriptions, examples, clarity
- **Schema Completeness** (25 points) - Request/response schemas, types
- **Error Handling** (20 points) - Error responses, status codes
- **Agent Usability** (20 points) - Naming, discoverability, complexity
- **Authentication Clarity** (10 points) - Auth documentation, examples

### 3. Test with Sample APIs
```bash
# Test with a simple API spec
python scorecard.py examples/simple-api.yaml

# Test with a complex API spec
python scorecard.py examples/complex-api.yaml

# Generate detailed report
python scorecard.py examples/github-api.yaml --detailed --output report.html
