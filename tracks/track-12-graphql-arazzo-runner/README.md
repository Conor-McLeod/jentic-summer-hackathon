# Track 12 – GraphQL Support in Arazzo Runner

**Goal**: Enable Arazzo workflows to execute GraphQL operations alongside REST APIs, with both conversion-based and native implementation approaches.

**Time Estimate**: 4-8 hours  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced  
**Perfect for**: Developers familiar with GraphQL, API integration, and workflow orchestration

## What You'll Build

**Two possible approaches**:

### Minimum Approach: GraphQL-to-OpenAPI Conversion
- Convert GraphQL schemas to OpenAPI specifications
- Map GraphQL queries/mutations to REST-like operations
- Enable existing Arazzo workflows to work with GraphQL APIs
- Handle GraphQL-specific concepts in REST translation

### Advanced Approach: Native GraphQL Support
- Extend Arazzo Runner with native GraphQL operation support
- Implement GraphQL-specific workflow steps and operations
- Handle GraphQL subscriptions, fragments, and advanced features
- Create GraphQL-aware workflow patterns

**Your deliverable**: Working GraphQL support in Arazzo Runner that enables workflows to seamlessly integrate GraphQL APIs with REST APIs.

## The Challenge

**Current State**: Arazzo Runner excellently handles REST APIs through OpenAPI specifications, but many modern services use GraphQL.

**The Gap**: GraphQL APIs have different paradigms:
- Single endpoint with query-based operations
- Schema introspection and type systems
- Nested queries and relationship traversal
- Subscriptions for real-time data
- Fragment reuse and composition

**The Solution**: Bridge GraphQL and Arazzo workflows to enable unified API orchestration.

## Understanding the Approaches

### Approach 1: Conversion-Based (Minimum)

**Concept**: Transform GraphQL schemas into OpenAPI specifications that Arazzo can understand.

**Benefits**:
- Works with existing Arazzo Runner without code changes
- Leverages existing OpenAPI tooling and validation
- Easier to implement and test
- Compatible with current workflow patterns

**Limitations**:
- May not capture full GraphQL semantics
- Complex nested queries might be awkward to represent
- Subscriptions are difficult to map to REST patterns
- Loses some GraphQL-specific optimizations

### Approach 2: Native Support (Advanced)

**Concept**: Extend Arazzo specification and runner to understand GraphQL operations directly.

**Benefits**:
- Full GraphQL feature support
- More natural workflow representation
- Better performance and semantics
- Supports advanced GraphQL features

**Limitations**:
- Requires changes to Arazzo Runner core
- More complex implementation
- Need to define new Arazzo extensions
- Requires deeper understanding of both systems

## Implementation Paths

### Path 1: GraphQL-to-OpenAPI Converter (4-6 hours)

#### Phase 1: Schema Analysis (1.5 hours)
```python
# Example implementation structure
class GraphQLToOpenAPIConverter:
    def convert_schema(self, graphql_schema: str) -> dict:
        # TODO: Parse GraphQL schema and convert to OpenAPI
        pass
    
    def extract_queries(self, schema: GraphQLSchema) -> List[OpenAPIPath]:
        # TODO: Convert GraphQL queries to REST-like GET operations
        pass
    
    def extract_mutations(self, schema: GraphQLSchema) -> List[OpenAPIPath]:
        # TODO: Convert GraphQL mutations to REST-like POST operations
        pass
    
    def generate_schemas(self, graphql_types: List[GraphQLType]) -> dict:
        # TODO: Convert GraphQL types to OpenAPI schemas
        pass
```

#### Key Conversion Challenges
- **Query Fields → GET Endpoints**: Map each query field to a REST endpoint
- **Mutation Fields → POST Endpoints**: Convert mutations to creation/update operations
- **GraphQL Types → OpenAPI Schemas**: Transform type definitions
- **Arguments → Parameters**: Map GraphQL arguments to query/path parameters
- **Nested Selections → Response Schemas**: Handle field selection in responses

#### Phase 2: Operation Mapping (1.5 hours)
```python
class GraphQLOperationMapper:
    def map_query_to_rest(self, query_field: GraphQLField) -> OpenAPIOperation:
        # TODO: Convert GraphQL query to REST GET operation
        pass
    
    def map_mutation_to_rest(self, mutation_field: GraphQLField) -> OpenAPIOperation:
        # TODO: Convert GraphQL mutation to REST POST/PUT operation
        pass
    
    def handle_nested_selection(self, selection_set: SelectionSet) -> OpenAPISchema:
        # TODO: Convert GraphQL field selections to response schemas
        pass
```

#### Phase 3: Workflow Integration (1-2 hours)
- Generate Arazzo workflows that use converted OpenAPI specs
- Handle GraphQL query execution through REST-like operations
- Map workflow parameters to GraphQL variables
- Test end-to-end workflow execution

### Path 2: Native GraphQL Support (6-8 hours)

#### Phase 1: Arazzo Extensions Design (2 hours)
Define new Arazzo operation types for GraphQL:

```yaml
# Example Arazzo workflow with GraphQL operations
arazzo: 1.0.0
info:
  title: GraphQL Workflow Example
  version: 1.0.0

workflows:
  - workflowId: graphqlExample
    steps:
      - stepId: getUserData
        operationRef: "#/operations/getUser"
        parameters:
          userId: $inputs.userId
      - stepId: updateUserProfile
        operationRef: "#/operations/updateUser"
        parameters:
          userId: $steps.getUserData.outputs.id
          profileData: $inputs.profileData

operations:
  - operationId: getUser
    type: graphql.query
    endpoint: https://api.example.com/graphql
    query: |
      query GetUser($userId: ID!) {
        user(id: $userId) {
          id
          name
          email
          profile {
            bio
            avatar
          }
        }
      }
    variables:
      userId: $parameters.userId

  - operationId: updateUser
    type: graphql.mutation
    endpoint: https://api.example.com/graphql
    mutation: |
      mutation UpdateUser($userId: ID!, $profileData: ProfileInput!) {
        updateUser(id: $userId, profile: $profileData) {
          id
          profile {
            bio
            avatar
          }
        }
      }
    variables:
      userId: $parameters.userId
      profileData: $parameters.profileData
```

#### Phase 2: Runner Implementation (3-4 hours)
```python
# Example runner extension
class GraphQLOperationExecutor:
    def execute_graphql_query(self, operation: GraphQLOperation, variables: dict) -> dict:
        # TODO: Execute GraphQL query against endpoint
        pass
    
    def execute_graphql_mutation(self, operation: GraphQLMutation, variables: dict) -> dict:
        # TODO: Execute GraphQL mutation against endpoint
        pass
    
    def handle_graphql_subscription(self, operation: GraphQLSubscription) -> AsyncIterator:
        # TODO: Handle GraphQL subscriptions (advanced)
        pass
```

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (1-2 hours)
- Fragment support and reuse
- Subscription handling for real-time workflows
- Error handling and GraphQL-specific error patterns
- Query optimization and batching

## GraphQL-Specific Considerations

### Schema Introspection
```python
def introspect_graphql_schema(endpoint: str) -> GraphQLSchema:
    """
    Use GraphQL introspection to discover schema structure.
    TODO: Implement introspection query and parsing
    """
    introspection_query = """
    query IntrospectionQuery {
      __schema {
        queryType { name }
        mutationType { name }
        subscriptionType { name }
        types {
          ...FullType
        }
      }
    }
    
    fragment FullType on __Type {
      kind
      name
      description
      fields(includeDeprecated: true) {
        name
        description
        args {
          ...InputValue
        }
        type {
          ...TypeRef
        }
      }
    }
    """
    # TODO: Execute introspection and parse results
```

### Type System Mapping
- **Scalars**: Map GraphQL scalars (String, Int, Boolean, ID) to OpenAPI types
- **Objects**: Convert GraphQL object types to OpenAPI schemas
- **Interfaces**: Handle GraphQL interfaces with OpenAPI inheritance
- **Unions**: Map GraphQL unions to OpenAPI oneOf/anyOf
- **Enums**: Direct mapping to OpenAPI enums
- **Input Types**: Convert to OpenAPI request schemas

### Query Complexity
```python
def analyze_query_complexity(query: str) -> ComplexityAnalysis:
    """
    Analyze GraphQL query complexity for workflow optimization.
    TODO: Implement query analysis and optimization suggestions
    """
    # Consider:
    # - Nested depth
    # - Field count
    # - Potential N+1 issues
    # - Cost analysis
```

## Testing Strategies

### Test with Public GraphQL APIs
- **GitHub GraphQL API**: Well-documented, requires authentication
- **SpaceX GraphQL API**: Public, no authentication required
- **Rick and Morty API**: Simple, good for testing basic functionality
- **Star Wars API**: Classic example with good type variety

### Test Scenarios
```yaml
# Example test workflow
arazzo: 1.0.0
info:
  title: GraphQL Test Workflow
  version: 1.0.0

workflows:
  - workflowId: testGraphQLIntegration
    steps:
      - stepId: fetchSpaceXLaunches
        # TODO: Define GraphQL operation to fetch SpaceX launches
      - stepId: processLaunchData
        # TODO: Process and transform the data
      - stepId: postToDiscord
        # TODO: Post results to Discord using REST API
```

### Validation Tests
- **Schema Conversion**: Verify converted schemas are valid OpenAPI
- **Operation Execution**: Test that GraphQL operations work correctly
- **Data Flow**: Ensure data passes correctly between workflow steps
- **Error Handling**: Test GraphQL errors are handled properly

## Integration Patterns

### Mixed Workflows (GraphQL + REST)
```yaml
# Example mixed workflow
workflows:
  - workflowId: mixedAPIWorkflow
    steps:
      - stepId: graphqlData
        operationType: graphql.query
        # Fetch data from GraphQL API
      - stepId: restProcessing
        operationType: rest.post
        # Send data to REST API for processing
      - stepId: graphqlUpdate
        operationType: graphql.mutation
        # Update GraphQL API with results
```

### Authentication Handling
- Support GraphQL APIs with various auth schemes
- Handle authentication in both conversion and native approaches
- Consider GraphQL-specific auth patterns (context-based auth)
