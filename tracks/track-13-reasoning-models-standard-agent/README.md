- **Experience** with AI/ML frameworks and LLM integration
- **Knowledge** of agent reasoning patterns and evaluation

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Understanding of agent reasoning literature (ReAct, CoT, ToT papers)
- Familiarity with tree search algorithms and evaluation functions
- Experience with prompt engineering and LLM behavior
- Knowledge of agent evaluation and benchmarking

### Setup Requirements
- Working Standard Agent development environment
- Access to capable LLM APIs (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)

## Understanding the Current System

### Existing Architecture
```python
# Current Standard Agent structure
class StandardAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm, tools, memory, reasoner):
        self.llm = llm
        self.tools = tools  # JenticClient for JITT
        self.memory = memory
        self.reasoner = reasoner  # Currently SequentialReasoner
    
    def solve(self, goal: str) -> str:
        return self.reasoner.reason(goal, self.tools, self.memory)

# Current ReWOO-based reasoning
class SequentialReasoner:
    def reason(self, goal, tools, memory):
        # Plan → Execute → Reflect → Summarize
        plan = self.plan(goal)
        results = self.execute_steps(plan, tools)
        reflection = self.reflect(results)
        return self.summarize_result(results, reflection)
```

### Extension Points
Your new reasoner should implement the `BaseReasoner` interface:

```python
class BaseReasoner:
    def reason(self, goal: str, tools: JustInTimeToolingBase, memory: MutableMapping) -> str:
        """Main reasoning entry point."""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

## Reasoning Model Implementations

### Track 13A: LATS Implementation

**Language Agent Tree Search** uses tree search with LLM-guided exploration and evaluation.

#### Core Components
```python
class LATSReasoner(BaseReasoner):
    def __init__(self, llm, max_depth=5, max_breadth=3):
        self.llm = llm
        self.max_depth = max_depth
        self.max_breadth = max_breadth
    
    def reason(self, goal: str, tools, memory) -> str:
        # TODO: Implement LATS tree search
        root = self.create_root_node(goal)
        best_path = self.tree_search(root, tools, memory)
        return self.execute_best_path(best_path, tools)
    
    def tree_search(self, node, tools, memory):
        # TODO: Implement tree search with LLM guidance
        # - Generate multiple reasoning branches
        # - Evaluate each branch with LLM
        # - Expand promising nodes
        # - Backtrack from dead ends
        pass
    
    def evaluate_node(self, node, tools, memory) -> float:
        # TODO: LLM-based node evaluation
        # Rate the reasoning quality and progress toward goal
        pass
    
    def generate_children(self, node, tools, memory):
        # TODO: Generate possible next reasoning steps
        # Use LLM to propose multiple approaches
        pass
```

#### Key Challenges
- **Evaluation Function**: How to score partial reasoning states
- **Search Strategy**: Balancing exploration vs exploitation
- **Memory Management**: Handling growing search trees
- **Tool Integration**: When and how to call tools during search

### Track 13B: Plan-Act Implementation

**Plan-Act** separates high-level planning from detailed execution.

#### Core Components
```python
class PlanActReasoner(BaseReasoner):
    def __init__(self, llm, max_plan_depth=3):
        self.llm = llm
        self.max_plan_depth = max_plan_depth
    
    def reason(self, goal: str, tools, memory) -> str:
        # TODO: Implement Plan-Act reasoning
        plan = self.create_hierarchical_plan(goal, tools)
        result = self.execute_plan(plan, tools, memory)
        return self.finalize_result(result)
    
    def create_hierarchical_plan(self, goal, tools):
        # TODO: Build hierarchical plan with sub-goals
        # - Break down complex goals into manageable parts
        # - Create dependency relationships
        # - Estimate resource requirements
        pass
    
    def execute_plan(self, plan, tools, memory):
        # TODO: Execute plan with adaptation
        # - Execute sub-goals in order
        # - Adapt plan based on results
        # - Handle failures and re-planning
        pass
    
    def replan_if_needed(self, current_plan, execution_results):
        # TODO: Decide when to replan and how to adapt
        pass
```

#### Key Challenges
- **Plan Granularity**: Right level of detail for plans
- **Adaptation Strategy**: When and how to modify plans
- **Dependency Management**: Handling complex goal relationships
- **Failure Recovery**: Robust replanning mechanisms

### Track 13C: ReAct Implementation

**ReAct** interleaves reasoning and acting in tight loops.

#### Core Components
```python
class ReActReasoner(BaseReasoner):
    def __init__(self, llm, max_iterations=10):
        self.llm = llm
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations
    
    def reason(self, goal: str, tools, memory) -> str:
        # TODO: Implement ReAct reasoning loop
        context = self.initialize_context(goal)
        
        for i in range(self.max_iterations):
            thought = self.generate_thought(context, tools)
            action = self.decide_action(thought, tools)
            
            if action == "FINISH":
                return self.generate_final_answer(context)
            
            observation = self.execute_action(action, tools)
            context = self.update_context(context, thought, action, observation)
        
        return self.generate_final_answer(context)
    
    def generate_thought(self, context, tools):
        # TODO: Generate reasoning step based on current context
        # Consider what to do next and why
        pass
    
    def decide_action(self, thought, tools):
        # TODO: Choose action based on reasoning
        # Could be tool call, information gathering, or finish
        pass
    
    def execute_action(self, action, tools):
        # TODO: Execute chosen action and observe results
        pass
```

#### Key Challenges

#### Core Components
```python
class TreeOfThoughtsReasoner(BaseReasoner):
    def __init__(self, llm, thoughts_per_step=3, max_depth=4):
        self.llm = llm
        self.thoughts_per_step = thoughts_per_step
        self.max_depth = max_depth
    
    def reason(self, goal: str, tools, memory) -> str:
        # TODO: Implement Tree-of-Thoughts reasoning
        thought_tree = self.build_thought_tree(goal, tools)
        best_path = self.evaluate_paths(thought_tree)
        return self.execute_best_path(best_path, tools)
    
    def generate_thoughts(self, current_state, tools, depth):
        # TODO: Generate multiple possible next thoughts
        # Explore different reasoning directions
        pass
    
    def evaluate_thought(self, thought, goal, tools) -> float:
        # TODO: Evaluate quality of individual thoughts
        # Rate progress toward goal and reasoning quality
        pass
    
    def build_thought_tree(self, goal, tools):
        # TODO: Build complete tree of reasoning possibilities
        # Breadth-first exploration of thought space
        pass
    
    def select_best_path(self, thought_tree):
        # TODO: Choose optimal reasoning path through tree
        pass
```

#### Key Challenges
- **Thought Generation**: Creating diverse, useful reasoning steps
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Scoring thought quality effectively
- **Tree Pruning**: Managing computational complexity
- **Path Selection**: Choosing optimal reasoning sequences

## Integration with Standard Agent

### Reasoner Interface Compliance
```python
# Your reasoner must work with existing Standard Agent
agent = StandardAgent(
    llm=LiteLLM(model="gpt-4"),
    tools=JenticClient(),
    memory=DictMemory(),
    reasoner=YourNewReasoner(llm)  # Your implementation
)

result = agent.solve("Complex multi-step task requiring advanced reasoning")
```

### Tool Integration Patterns
- **JITT Integration**: Use JenticClient for just-in-time tool loading
- **Tool Selection**: Smart selection of tools based on reasoning state
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of tool failures
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API limits during extensive reasoning

### Memory Management
```python
# Use memory for reasoning state persistence
class AdvancedReasoner(BaseReasoner):
    def reason(self, goal, tools, memory):
        # Store reasoning state in memory
        memory['reasoning_state'] = self.initialize_state(goal)
        memory['reasoning_history'] = []
        
        # Use memory throughout reasoning process
        # TODO: Implement memory-aware reasoning
```

## Evaluation and Testing

### Test Scenarios
Create comprehensive tests for your reasoning model:

```python
# Example test cases
test_cases = [
    {
        "goal": "Research climate change solutions and create a presentation",
        "expected_steps": ["research", "synthesize", "create"],
        "complexity": "high"
    },
    {
        "goal": "Find the best restaurant in Paris and make a reservation",
        "expected_steps": ["search", "evaluate", "book"],
        "complexity": "medium"
    },
    # TODO: Add more test cases
]
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Task Success Rate**: How often does the reasoner complete tasks correctly?
- **Reasoning Quality**: How coherent and logical are the reasoning steps?
- **Efficiency**: How many LLM calls are needed per task?
- **Tool Usage**: How effectively are tools selected and used?
- **Error Recovery**: How well does the reasoner handle failures?

### Comparison Studies
Compare your new reasoner against the existing ReWOO implementation:

```python
def comparative_evaluation():
    # TODO: Implement head-to-head comparison
    # - Same tasks with different reasoners
    # - Measure performance differences
    # - Analyze reasoning quality
    # - Compare resource usage
```
