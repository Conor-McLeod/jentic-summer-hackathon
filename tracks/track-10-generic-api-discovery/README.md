# Track 10 â€“ Generic API Discovery (Open-Ended)

**Goal**: "There are websites that don't have APIs or documented APIs. We would like to have their APIs. You figure it out."

**Time Estimate**: 3-8 hours (varies widely by approach)  
**Difficulty**: Beginner to Advanced (depends on chosen method)  
**Perfect for**: Creative problem solvers, reverse engineers, and developers who like open-ended challenges

## What You'll Build

**Your choice!** This track is intentionally open-ended. You can:
- **Web scrape** and create API specifications from scraped patterns
- **Reverse engineer** mobile apps to find hidden API endpoints
- **Manually document** APIs by observing network traffic
- **Build custom tooling** for automated API discovery
- **Create hybrid approaches** combining multiple techniques
- **Focus on specific domains** (e-commerce, news, social media)

**Your deliverable**: Working OpenAPI specifications for previously undocumented APIs, plus documentation of your discovery methodology.

## The Challenge

Many valuable services have **no public APIs**:
- Local business directories
- Government services portals
- Legacy enterprise systems
- Mobile-only applications
- Single-page applications with hidden endpoints
- Real estate platforms
- Restaurant/booking systems

**Your mission**: Make the invisible visible. Document these hidden APIs so agents and developers can use them.

## Possible Approaches

### Method 1: Web Scraping + API Inference
- Analyze website structure and data patterns
- Build scrapers that mimic API responses
- Create OpenAPI specs that describe the scraped data
- **Tools**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, Playwright

### Method 2: Network Traffic Analysis
- Monitor browser network requests while using websites
- Identify AJAX/fetch patterns that aren't documented
- Reverse engineer request/response formats
- **Tools**: Browser DevTools, mitmproxy, Wireshark

### Method 3: Mobile App Reverse Engineering
- Decompile mobile apps to find API endpoints
- Analyze network requests from mobile applications
- Document mobile-specific APIs
- **Tools**: mitmproxy, Frida, Android/iOS debugging tools

### Method 4: Manual API Documentation
- Use websites extensively and document all network calls
- Create comprehensive API documentation from observation
- Focus on completeness and accuracy
- **Tools**: Postman, Insomnia, curl, manual testing

### Method 5: Automated Discovery Tools
- Build tools that automatically discover API patterns
- Create intelligent crawlers that find undocumented endpoints
- Use AI to predict likely API structures
- **Tools**: Custom scripts, LLMs, pattern recognition

### Method 6: Hybrid Approaches
- Combine multiple methods for comprehensive coverage
- Use automation where possible, manual verification where needed
- Focus on specific industry verticals

## Target Ideas

### High-Value Targets
- **Real Estate Sites**: Property search, listing details, market data
- **Job Boards**: Job search, company information, salary data
- **Local Business**: Restaurant menus, business hours, reviews
- **Government**: Public records, permits, regulatory data
- **E-commerce**: Product catalogs, pricing, inventory

### Technical Targets
- **SPA Applications**: React/Vue apps with hidden API calls
- **Mobile Web**: Mobile-optimized sites with different endpoints
- **Legacy Systems**: Older websites with form-based interactions
- **Geo-specific**: Location-based services and directories

## Implementation Guidelines

### Choose Your Focus
1. **Pick a domain** you're interested in or familiar with
2. **Select 1-3 websites** to focus on (don't spread too thin)
3. **Choose your methodology** based on your skills and tools
4. **Set realistic scope** - even 1 well-documented API is valuable

### Discovery Process
1. **Reconnaissance**: Explore the website/service thoroughly
2. **Pattern Identification**: Look for data that could be API-driven
3. **Technical Analysis**: Use your chosen tools to find endpoints
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive OpenAPI specifications
5. **Validation**: Test your documented APIs work correctly

### Quality Standards
- **Accuracy**: APIs you document should work as described
- **Completeness**: Cover the main functionality of the service
- **Clarity**: Provide clear descriptions and examples
- **Reproducibility**: Others should be able to verify your findings

## Deliverables

### Minimum Viable Product
- [ ] **1 working OpenAPI specification** for an undocumented API
- [ ] **Discovery methodology** documentation explaining your approach
- [ ] **Validation evidence** showing the API works (screenshots, tests)
- [ ] **Usage examples** demonstrating key functionality

### Enhanced Submission
- [ ] **Multiple API specifications** (2-5 different services)
- [ ] **Automated tooling** for ongoing discovery or monitoring
- [ ] **Comprehensive documentation** of discovery process
- [ ] **Industry analysis** comparing APIs across similar services

### Professional Quality
- [ ] **Production-ready specs** suitable for agent integration
- [ ] **Discovery framework** that others can use
- [ ] **Legal compliance analysis** for discovered APIs
- [ ] **Contribution to Jentic Public APIs** repository

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

### Best Practices
- **Respect robots.txt** and rate limits
- **Don't overload servers** with excessive requests
- **Consider terms of service** - avoid violating ToS
- **Focus on public data** available through normal website usage
- **Document responsibly** - don't expose private or sensitive endpoints

### Legal Guidelines
- Only document APIs for **publicly accessible information**
- Avoid accessing **user-specific or private data**
- Don't document APIs that require **authentication bypass**
- Consider **fair use** principles in your documentation
- When in doubt, **ask for permission** from site owners

## Technical Tips

### Web Scraping
- Use **respectful crawling** practices (delays, user agents)
- Handle **dynamic content** with headless browsers
- **Cache responses** to avoid repeated requests
- **Structure data consistently** for API specification generation

### Network Analysis
- Use **private browsing** to avoid personalized responses
- **Clear browser state** between sessions for consistent results
- **Document authentication flows** if publicly available
- **Capture multiple examples** of requests/responses

### Reverse Engineering
- Focus on **publicly documented functionality**
- Use **official mobile apps** rather than modifying them
- **Document observed behavior** rather than internal implementation
- **Verify findings** through multiple sources
